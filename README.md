# Linux Network Security Tools

This repository contains a collection of Linux-based tools designed for network security and ethical hacking. Each script is written in Python and is focused on a specific aspect of network security, from ARP spoofing to password cracking.

## Tools Included

1. **arp_spoof.py**: Performs ARP spoofing to intercept network traffic between hosts.
2. **linux_pass_cracker.py**: A basic password cracker for Linux systems.
3. **mac_changer.py**: Changes the MAC address of your network interface to maintain anonymity.
4. **network_scanner.py**: Scans and identifies active devices on a network.
5. **packet_sniffer.py**: Captures and analyzes network packets in real-time.
6. **tcp_scanner.py**: Scans open TCP ports on a target host.
7. **zip_cracker.py**: Cracks password-protected ZIP files using a brute-force method.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure that Python is installed on your system.
- **Scapy**: For packet crafting and manipulation.
  
  ```bash
  pip install scapy
